    <h4>Bharatanatyam is a dance of Tamil Nadu in southern India.</h4>
    <h4> It traces its origins back to the Natyashastra, an ancient treatise on theatre written by the mythic priest Bharata.</h4>
    <h4>Originally a temple dance for women, bharatanatyam often is used to express Hindu religious stories and devotions.</h4>
